Random ideas:
- let the user mark a habit as complete on another date if he forgot it on the current date
    - will lead to the possibility that he marks the date wrong
    - need to implement the option to delete completions
    - need to not forget to reset streaks whenever such changes are made

Libraries:
- pathlib offers a clean, intuitive, and cross-platform way to manage file paths compared to traditional
 string-based operations. This helps prevent errors (e.g., when different operating systems use different path
 separators) and simplifies file I/O in Python.
