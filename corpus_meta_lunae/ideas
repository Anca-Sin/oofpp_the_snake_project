- refactor check_off_habit and separate check if habit is fully completed for clarity

- accommodate streaks for custom frequency

- let the user mark a habit as complete on another date if he forgot it on the current date
    - will lead to the possibility that he marks the date wrong
    - need to implement the option to delete completions
    - need to not forget to reset streaks whenever such changes are made
